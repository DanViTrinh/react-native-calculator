# Calculator

A minimalistic calulator that mimics the functionality of scientific calulators.
Built using react native.

## Problem with other calculators

Most scientific calculator and calculator apps does not have the exact same
functionality as a real scientific calculator.
The apps that do have the exact same functionality are outdated.
An example of such a functionality is how the division button (÷) acts. On a
scientific calulator the division button creates a $\frac{☐}{☐}$ where the next
number will appear on the numerator. The applications that do have this feature
like photomath the next number appears on the denominator.

Because of issues like this I decided to create my own calculator, in addtion
to using this to learn react native.

## Build instructions

```bash
cd calculator && npx expo start
```
